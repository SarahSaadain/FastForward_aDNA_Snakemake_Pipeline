"""
Backwards compatibility for renamed config keys.

When a config key is renamed, the old name keeps working: apply_config_key_aliases()
moves the old key's value onto the new name before anything else reads the config, so
the rest of the pipeline only ever sees current key names and no `.get("<old name>", {})`
fallback chains are needed at the read sites. Called once from workflow/rules/initialize.smk,
directly after the configfile is loaded, and mirrored by workflow/scripts/pipeline_namespace.py so
`pastForward check`/`preview` and the unit tests see the same normalised config the real run
does.
