# =================================================================================================
#     Species Data Location Setup
# =================================================================================================
# Resolves optional per-species data-location overrides (species.<key>.species_dir /
# reads_dir / reference_dir / scg_dir / feature_library_dir / competition_dir / processed_dir /
# results_dir) into symlinks at the conventional "<species>/..." locations pastForward's rules
# already reference as literal strings. Called once from initialize.smk, before Snakemake parses
# any rule, so every existing "{species}/input/..." / "{species}/processed/..." /
# "{species}/results/..." path in the rule files resolves through the symlink transparently.
#
# When nothing is configured for a species/category, none of this runs for it — the directory
# entry (or its absence) is left exactly as pastForward has always expected it.
#
# Imported (not `include`d) from initialize.smk/Snakefile, the same way initialize.smk already
# does `from scripts.version import __version__` — this keeps helper/internal names out of the
# shared rule-file namespace that file_manager.py populates via `include:`.
